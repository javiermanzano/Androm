# ANDROM - ORM made easy in Android

This framework pretends to be an usefull and easy to use ORM framework for the Android platform. It won't be focused on perfomance (although it's one of its goals) because it's built upon reflection.

One of the goals of this development is to provide an easy to use framework so everyone can do Data access in Android very easy.

# Development

Nowadays this is under heavy development and cannot be used in production. You just should use this in order to test it and give me feedback of what you want to find in this little framework.

# Info

You can find more info, when its available, on its webpage [Androm](http://www.jmanzano.es/androm).
